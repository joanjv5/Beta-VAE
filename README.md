# Beta-VAE
Modal decomposition of 2D cylinder of Re = 100 with Disentngled Variational Autoencoder
The vae2.py file is the corresponent to the training of the Variational Autoencoder.
THe sim_ae.py is the corresponent to the training of the Autoencoder
dataset, tools  and classesfiles are not important in temrs of results.
various_plots contain algorithms for plotting figures for the report
energy plots the energy captured of a determined model
plot_modes_instants.py is used for plotting modes and reconstructed instants, aswell as original ones
